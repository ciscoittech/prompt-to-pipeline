# Book Editor Skill

## Purpose

Review chapter drafts to ensure they meet quality standards for a non-technical audience. Score against the 6-dimension rubric and provide specific revision notes.

## Review Process

1. Read the draft end-to-end
2. Run each check in `references/checklist.md`
3. Score against the 6-dimension rubric (see `book-writer/references/scoring.md`)
4. Write specific revision notes — not "improve clarity" but "paragraph 3 uses 'context window' without translation"
5. Flag any dimension scoring < 3 for rewrite

## What to Check

### Voice Scan
- [ ] No AI tells (see `book-writer/references/voice.md` for the full list)
- [ ] Conversational tone throughout — reads like a person, not a manual
- [ ] Varied sentence length (not all 15-20 word sentences)
- [ ] Varied paragraph length (mix of 1-sentence and 3-4 sentence paragraphs)
- [ ] No hedging ("it might be possible to perhaps..." → "do this")
- [ ] No corporate speak ("provides value across use cases" → cut it)

### Jargon Scan
- [ ] Every technical term has a plain-language equivalent (see `book-writer/references/anti-jargon.md`)
- [ ] UI terms used as-is with translation on first use
- [ ] No unexplained acronyms
- [ ] No assumed knowledge (don't say "open your terminal" — the reader may not know what that is)

### Accessibility Check
- [ ] Steps start with verbs ("Open", "Click", "Type")
- [ ] What Claude does at each step is described (reader knows what to expect)
- [ ] Error states are covered ("If Claude asks for permission, click Allow")
- [ ] No assumed familiarity with other AI tools

### System Completeness
- [ ] Act 1 chapters follow: Hook → Concept → Exercise → Limitation → Assessment
- [ ] Act 2 component chapters follow: Problem → See System → New Component → Build It → Extend It → Maintain It → Diagram → Break It → Quality Gate
- [ ] Act 2 integration chapters follow: What You Have → How They Connect → Build It → Design Principles → Quality Gate
- [ ] Quality gate checks are concrete and verifiable
- [ ] Prompts follow the 4-part formula (Act 2)
- [ ] CLI commands shown, files visible (Act 2)

### Progression Check
- [ ] No forward references to later chapters
- [ ] Prior concepts referenced with brief reminders
- [ ] Difficulty level matches chapter position (early = simpler)
