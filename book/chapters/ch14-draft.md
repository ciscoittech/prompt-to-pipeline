# Chapter 14: Designing New Systems — From Problem to Blueprint

You've built four systems by following this book. Someone told you what file to create, what to type in it, when to run it. You followed the steps and it worked.

That's not design. That's assembly.

A person who assembles four IKEA bookshelves can put together a fifth IKEA bookshelf. A person who understands why bookshelves work — load distribution, shelf spacing, back panel rigidity — can build a bookshelf from raw lumber when there's no instruction manual.

This chapter is the raw lumber. You pick a problem the book never covered. You design the system. You build it. The chapter gives you the process, not the answer.

## When to Build a System vs. When a Prompt Is Fine

Not everything needs a system. Three conditions have to be true before you start building:

**You do the task repeatedly.** Weekly or daily. If it's quarterly, a prompt works fine. Systems have overhead — creating files, maintaining state, tuning hooks. That overhead only pays off with repetition.

**Context carries between sessions.** What happened last time matters this time. If every instance is independent — translating a paragraph, brainstorming names, summarizing a one-off article — a prompt handles it. No memory needed means no system needed.

**Mistakes cost something real.** If bad output means redoing 10 minutes of work, a prompt is fine. If bad output means a fabricated credential on a cover letter, an unsourced claim in a published post, or an allergic reaction from a meal plan — build a system.

The test: "Would this task be better if it remembered what happened last time?" If yes, you need at least state. That's the start of a system.

Tasks that don't need systems: translating a paragraph (one-shot, no context carries). Brainstorming project names (creative, disposable, no stakes). Summarizing a single article (independent, low-cost if wrong).

Tasks that do: managing client relationships over months (context carries, mistakes cost trust). Planning meals for a household each week (recurring, context carries — what you bought, what you ate, dietary restrictions). Running a side business's books (recurring, high-stakes, patterns matter over time).

The four systems in this book were chosen because all three conditions are obviously true. For your new system, verify all three before you start building. A system for a task that doesn't need one is worse than no system — it's overhead with no payoff.

## The 8-Step Design Process

I'm going to walk through each step with a running example — meal planning — so you can see how the decisions work. You're not building a meal planning system. You're building something else. The example shows the process. Your decisions are yours.

### Step 1: Start with frustration.

What task do you do repeatedly that AI helps with inconsistently? Write it down. Not "I want to use AI for meal planning" — that's a solution looking for a problem. Start with the frustration.

"I spend 30 minutes every Sunday planning meals for the week, and every time I ask for help, I re-explain my dietary restrictions, what's in my fridge, and what we ate last week. The suggestions repeat. The grocery list doesn't account for what I already have. And last month it suggested a recipe with walnuts — I'm allergic to walnuts."

The frustration tells you what's broken. "I re-explain every time" = no memory. "Suggestions repeat" = no history tracking. "Didn't account for what I have" = no current state. "Suggested something I'm allergic to" = no guard rails. The frustration IS the diagnosis.

Your turn. Write your frustration in one sentence. If you can't articulate it, you don't have a system problem yet — you have a vague desire. Come back when the frustration is specific.

### Step 2: Map your current workflow.

How are you doing this task right now? What do you paste into the AI? What do you re-explain? What do you check manually after?

Draw it:

```
[What you type] → [AI] → [What you get] → [What you check/fix by hand]
```

Everything after the last arrow is work the system should be doing.

Meal planning example: "I paste my dietary restrictions, what's in my fridge, what we ate this week, and ask for meal plans. I check that nothing contains allergens, that it uses fridge ingredients before suggesting purchases, and that it doesn't repeat Monday's dinner on Thursday."

Your turn. Map your current workflow. What do you paste? What do you check? What do you wish it remembered?

<!-- DIAGRAM NEEDED: The "before" workflow — a simple linear diagram showing [What you type] -> [AI] -> [What you get] -> [What you check/fix by hand], with the manual work highlighted as the problem area. -->

### Step 3: Identify the constraint.

Of everything that breaks, what breaks MOST or costs the MOST? That's the constraint. Fix that first. Ignore everything else until it's resolved.

Meal planning: "The allergy check is the constraint. If the meal plan includes something I'm allergic to and I don't catch it, that's a health risk. Everything else is inconvenience. This one is safety."

Your constraint might be different. Maybe it's accuracy — the system fabricates data you can't easily verify. Maybe it's consistency — the output quality swings wildly between sessions. Maybe it's completeness — it handles the easy cases but drops the hard ones.

Name it. One constraint. That's where you start.

### Step 4: Choose a pattern.

Loop, Gate, or Router — from Chapter 3. Most systems combine two or three. Pick the primary one.

- If your task improves through iteration (draft, check, improve, repeat) — it's a **Loop**.
- If your task has a quality bar that output must pass before you use it — it's a **Gate**.
- If different inputs need different handling — it's a **Router**.

Meal planning: Gate. The meal plan must pass allergy and dietary checks before I use it. I don't revise meal plans iteratively (not a Loop). All weeks get the same treatment (not a Router).

Sketch yours on a napkin. Boxes and arrows. If you can't sketch it with these three shapes, it's too complicated — simplify.

### Step 5: Start minimal — prompt only.

Build v1: just a CLAUDE.md and a structured prompt. No state file. No skills. No hooks. No connections. No pipeline.

This will feel like going backward. You just spent ten chapters building systems with six components each. Starting with prompt-only feels like regression.

It's not. You know what all six components do. You've built them all. But for YOUR system, you don't know which ones you need yet. The only way to find out is to start with the prompt and let the failures tell you.

Meal planning v1: Create `meal-planning/CLAUDE.md` with dietary restrictions, household size, cooking skill level, and a structured prompt: "Given what's in my fridge and our schedule this week, generate a 7-day meal plan with a grocery list for items I don't already have."

Run it. It works for one week. Next week, it re-plans Monday's dinner because it doesn't remember last week. It suggests a recipe with walnuts because the allergy list isn't reliably loaded. Two failures, two components needed.

Your turn. Build v1. Run it for real. What broke? Name the failure. Which component prevents it?

### Step 6: Add one component at a time.

For each failure, add the component that prevents it. One at a time. Run the system after each addition to verify the fix before adding the next.

The order depends on your constraint from Step 3:

- Biggest problem is "it forgets" → add **State**
- Biggest problem is "output quality is inconsistent" → add **Skill**
- Biggest problem is "it makes dangerous errors" → add **Hook**
- Biggest problem is "it needs information I don't have" → add **Connection**
- Biggest problem is "it tries to do everything at once" → add **Pipeline**

Meal planning: the constraint is allergy safety. Add a Hook first — a script that checks every recipe against the allergy list before the meal plan is finalized. Run it. The hook catches the walnut recipe. Good. Now add State — so it remembers what was planned and eaten, what's in the fridge, what worked. Run it. Next week's plan avoids last week's meals and uses existing ingredients. Good. Then add Skill — cooking methodology, preferred cuisines, complexity levels for weeknights vs. weekends. The output starts matching how the household actually eats.

Three components, added one at a time, each one earning its place by preventing a specific failure.

Your turn. Which component does your system need FIRST? Add it. Run the system. Verify. Then identify the next.

### Step 7: Test by breaking.

Feed your system bad input. Skip steps. Lie to it. See what fails.

Meal planning: Tell the system "I have no dietary restrictions" when you actually do. Does the hook still catch allergens? It should — the hook references a fixed allergy file, not what you said in the session. If the hook relies on your session input instead of the skill file, it's brittle. Fix it.

For each failure that matters, add a check. For failures that don't matter (the system handles them gracefully or the consequences are trivial), leave them alone. Not every edge case needs a hook.

Your turn. What's the worst thing your system could do? Test that scenario deliberately. Did it fail safely or fail silently?

### Step 8: Document.

Create the system diagram. List each component, what it does, and what failure it prevents. Write a one-paragraph maintenance plan.

Meal planning:

```
[Fridge contents + schedule] + [CLAUDE.md + cooking skill + meal-state.md]
                                        |
                                     [Claude]
                                        |
                                [ALLERGY HOOK CHECK]
                                   |            |
                               [PASS]      [FAIL: flag unsafe recipe]
                                  |
                   [Meal plan + grocery list + state updated]
```

Components: CLAUDE.md (preferences, household size). Cooking skill (cuisines, complexity levels, format preferences). `meal-state.md` (what was planned, what was eaten, what's in the fridge, what worked). Allergy-check hook (hard stop on unsafe recipes).

Monthly maintenance: update fridge staples list, review whether preferred cuisines have shifted, verify allergy list is current, archive meal plans older than 8 weeks.

Your turn. Draw the diagram. List the components. Write the maintenance plan.

<!-- DIAGRAM NEEDED: The 8-step design process as a visual flow — from Frustration through Document — showing where the reader loops back (Step 6 adds components iteratively) and where gates exist (Step 7 tests by breaking). -->

## The Four Anti-Patterns

These are the traps that kill new systems. You'll be tempted by at least one of them. Name them now so you catch yourself later.

### "Just add more to the prompt."

Your CLAUDE.md is 2,000 words and growing. Every time something goes wrong, you add another paragraph of instructions. The file becomes a wall of text that contradicts itself in subtle ways. Claude pays attention to the top, skims the middle, and mostly ignores the bottom.

What's actually happening: you need a skill (for expertise that doesn't change per-task), a state file (for session memory), or a hook (for quality checks). The prompt is becoming a dumping ground for things that belong in other components.

The tell: if you've added to your CLAUDE.md three or more times for the same kind of problem, it's not a prompt issue. Identify which component should own that concern and move it there.

### "Build it all at once."

You design the perfect 6-component system on paper. Day one: CLAUDE.md, state file, 3 skills, 4 hooks, 2 connections, and a 5-stage pipeline. You spend 3 hours building and zero minutes using.

The first session reveals that 2 of your hooks fire on perfectly good output, your state file tracks things you don't actually need, and one of your pipeline stages is redundant. You're now debugging 6 components instead of validating 1.

Start with prompt only. Add one component when you can NAME the failure it prevents. If you can't name the failure, you don't need the component yet.

### "Automate everything."

You build a system for a task you do quarterly that takes 10 minutes. The system took 3 hours to build. The maintenance takes 15 minutes a month, every month, forever.

The math: you'll recover the build time in... three years, assuming nothing changes. Something will change.

Rule of thumb: if you'll use the system less than once a week, think hard. Less than once a month? A prompt is almost certainly better. Systems are for repeated work where the compound benefit of memory, expertise, and guard rails outweighs the setup and maintenance cost.

### "Set it and forget it."

You built the system 3 months ago. It ran well then. You haven't looked at it since. The state file has 200 rows of stale data — Claude's attention is spread across applications from January that went nowhere. The skill describes your situation 3 months ago, before you changed industries. One hook hasn't fired in 8 weeks because the skill already prevents what the hook used to catch.

Systems decay. Circumstances change. A system that worked in January may be actively misleading in April — and you won't notice because the output looks plausible.

Schedule maintenance. Thirty minutes a month. Review state, skills, hooks, connections, and pipeline performance. Read the maintenance sections from the chapters where you built each component (state hygiene in Ch 5, skill versioning in Ch 6, hook tuning in Ch 7, connection health in Ch 8, pipeline bottlenecks in Ch 9). Those sections exist because this anti-pattern is real and common.

## Your Turn: Build It

This is your solo flight. The chapter holds the guardrails. You do the work.

**Pick a domain.** Here are some that naturally benefit from systems — all three conditions (repeated, context carries, mistakes cost something) are true for each:

- Personal finance tracking and budget planning
- Fitness and health tracking
- Client or freelance project management
- Travel planning for recurring trips
- Home maintenance scheduling
- Language learning
- Team management and 1:1 preparation
- Side business operations
- Event planning
- Research projects (academic, market, competitive)

Pick the one where you feel the frustration from Step 1 most strongly. If none of these match, use your own. The process works for any domain where all three conditions are true.

**Now walk through the 8 steps.** Not as a thought exercise — actually build it.

**Step 1:** Write your frustration sentence. What's broken about how you do this task with AI today?

**Step 2:** Draw your current workflow. What do you paste, check, re-explain every time?

**Step 3:** What's the constraint? What breaks most or costs the most when it goes wrong?

**Step 4:** Which pattern? Sketch it on paper. Boxes and arrows.

**Step 5:** Build v1. Just CLAUDE.md and a structured prompt. Open your terminal, create the folder, create the file. Run it.

**Step 6:** What broke? Add one component. Run again. What broke? Add the next. Keep going until the system handles your top 3 failures.

**Step 7:** Break it on purpose. Feed it the worst-case input. Does it fail safely?

**Step 8:** Draw the system diagram. List your components. Write the maintenance plan.

If you're stuck at any step, go back to the system in this book that's closest to yours. How did the Study System handle state? How did the Job Hunting System handle hooks? How did the Content System handle skills? The patterns transfer. That's the whole point of patterns.

## Check Your Design

Five questions to evaluate the system you just built.

**Can you name what each component prevents?** For every file in your system, say: "If I removed this, [specific bad thing] would happen." If you can't name the failure, you might not need the component. Remove it and test.

**Does the system start simple and grow?** Run the system with only the CLAUDE.md. Then add state. Then skill. At each stage, the system should produce measurably better output. If adding a component doesn't improve things, it's not earning its place.

**Is the prompt under control?** Your CLAUDE.md should be under 500 words. If it's longer, expertise probably belongs in a skill, session data belongs in state, and quality checks belong in hooks. The prompt orchestrates. Other components do the work.

**Can you break it safely?** Feed the system its worst-case input. Does it fail loudly (hook catches it, flags it, stops) or fail silently (bad output ships and you don't notice)? If it fails silently, you need a hook for that failure mode.

**Is there a maintenance plan?** What will you check monthly? What might drift? When would you update the skill? When would you archive stale state? A system without maintenance is a system with an expiration date you can't see.

---

## How to Know It's Clicking

Five checks:

**You built a system for a new problem.** Not a copy of the Study System with different labels. A different domain with different requirements, different constraints, different component priorities.

**The system has at least 3 components.** At minimum: CLAUDE.md, a state file, and either a skill or a hook. More is fine if each component prevents a named failure. Fewer means you might not need a system — a prompt might be enough.

**You followed the process, not your instinct.** You started with prompt-only v1. You ran it. You identified what broke. You added components one at a time. You didn't design the full system on paper and build it all at once.

**You can draw the architecture.** On a napkin, on a whiteboard, on the back of a receipt. Every component, what it does, one sentence each. If you can't explain it simply, it's too complicated.

**The system works for real.** Not a thought experiment. You ran it. It produced output. The output got better with each component you added. The hooks caught at least one bad input when you tested by breaking.

You just designed and built a system the book never taught you. The four systems were training wheels. This one is yours. You chose the domain, identified the constraint, picked the pattern, decided which components to add and in what order. That's the skill. Everything else in this book was building toward this.
