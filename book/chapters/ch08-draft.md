# Chapter 8: Connections — Your Systems Reach the Outside World

Your Study System is working. State file tracks your weak areas — networking at 62%, IAM at 68%, storage at 81%. The study-method skill calibrates explanations to how you learn. The quiz hook verifies every question has four options and one correct answer. You sit down for a Thursday evening session.

"Quiz me on VPC peering. I keep getting these questions wrong."

Claude pulls your state file, sees networking is flagged weak, loads your skill, and generates five questions. You take the quiz. Score: 3 out of 5. Claude updates your state. Same as last week.

Here's the problem. Those questions came from the same pool of knowledge Claude already has. Your notes are three months old. AWS released a new VPC feature last Tuesday that's already appearing on practice exams. A blog post on Medium explains peering better than anything in your study materials — using an analogy about apartment buildings that would have clicked for you immediately. A community site has 40 free practice questions specifically for the networking section of your exam.

Your system doesn't know any of that exists.

The state file knows you're weak on networking. The skill file knows you learn best through analogies. The hook verifies quiz quality. But none of those components can DO anything about the weakness except re-quiz you on the same material. The system can only work with what you've already given it. And you're the bottleneck — the only way new information gets in is if you find it yourself, copy it, and paste it into a file.

You could spend 30 minutes searching for better material, formatting it, and saving it where Claude can find it. But that's you doing the research manually. That's exactly the kind of work you built the system to handle.

What you need: the system goes out and GETS information. Searches the web for better explanations. Pulls your course materials from wherever you keep them. Finds practice resources you didn't know existed. The system becomes a researcher, not just a tutor.

A connection is a link that lets Claude reach outside your project folder — searching the web, pulling data from tools you already use, or finding information you haven't manually provided.

Your Study System right now:

```
[Your notes] + [CLAUDE.md + study-method skill + study-state.md]
                              |
                          [Claude]

                              |
                    [HOOKS CHECK: quiz quality]
```

Everything inside the box is working well. But everything OUTSIDE the box is invisible. The system processes what you've given it — and nothing more.

After this chapter:

```
[Your notes] + [CLAUDE.md + Skill + State]
             + [Web search results]
             + [Google Drive course materials (optional)]
                              |
                          [Claude]
                              |
                 [Quiz + Explanations using ALL sources]
                              |
                    [HOOKS CHECK: quiz quality + source verification]
```

Two new arrows feed into the system from outside. The box is open. The system sees more than you told it.

## The New Component: Connections

A connection lets Claude pull data from outside your project folder — the same way you'd open a browser tab, check your Google Drive, or look something up while working.

Here's what caught me off guard: some connections are already built in. Claude can search the web and fetch pages without you installing anything. You just have to tell it that's allowed. Others — connecting to tools like Notion, Google Drive, or a database — need a one-time setup. And a third category, connecting to local tools on your computer, needs a bit more work.

**Three types of connections you'll use:**

**Web search and page fetching.** Claude searches the web or reads a specific URL. You ask "find alternative explanations of VPC peering" and Claude searches, reads what it finds, and uses that information in its response. These are built-in tools — they ship with Claude Code. No installation, no configuration beyond giving permission. This is where you start.

**Remote server connections.** Think of these as plugins for cloud tools. A remote connection links Claude to a specific service — Notion, Sentry, Stripe, Google Drive, Slack. Once connected, Claude can read data from that tool. The technical name is "MCP server" (Model Context Protocol) — but just think of it as a plugin that connects Claude to a tool you already use. Setup is one command and a browser login.

**Local server connections.** These connect Claude to programs running on your own computer — a local database, a folder of files outside your project, a custom script. They need Node.js installed and a bit more terminal comfort. Optional for this book. Mentioned so you know they exist.

**When to connect vs. when local files are enough:**

Your career history doesn't change between sessions. Keep it in a skill file. No connection needed.

You need the current version of AWS documentation, not the version from Claude's training data. Web search.

Your course materials live in Google Drive and you're tired of copy-pasting them. Remote server connection.

You have a folder of study PDFs on your computer that lives outside your project. Local server connection — or just copy them into your project folder. Simpler.

**The trade-off nobody warns you about.** Connections are powerful but fragile. Websites go down. Authentication expires. Services change their setup. Local files are always available. A system that REQUIRES a connection to function is a system that breaks when WiFi drops.

Build your connections as enhancements, not foundations. The system should work without them — give you a narrower answer using local data rather than crash because it can't reach the web.

## Build It: Study System v5 — Adding Connections

**Components Used:** `[Prompt (CLAUDE.md)] + [State] + [Skill] + [Hook] + [Connection (NEW)]`

### Step 1: Enable web search — the zero-setup connection.

Claude Code already has web search and page fetching built in. They're not plugins you install. They're tools that ship with the software. You just need to give permission.

Open your `.claude/settings.json` — the same file where you registered hooks in Chapter 7. Add a permissions section:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "WebSearch",
      "WebFetch"
    ]
  },
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash .claude/hooks/verify-cover-letter.sh"
          },
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "bash .claude/hooks/check-duplicate.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Same file, new section. Your `settings.json` is the control panel for the whole system — hooks on one side, permissions on the other. One file configures everything.

What this does: tells Claude Code it's allowed to search the web and fetch pages during your sessions. Without this, Claude only knows what's in your files and its training data. With it, Claude can look things up in real time.

If you prefer a graphical interface, these same permissions can be set in Cowork or VS Code settings.

### Step 2: Update the Study System's CLAUDE.md.

Permission alone isn't enough. Claude needs to know WHEN to search and HOW to use what it finds. Open `study-system/CLAUDE.md` and add a new section:

```markdown
## Connections

You have web search access. Use it when:
- I'm weak on a topic (check study-state.md) and need a better explanation
  than what's in my notes
- A concept needs a current, real-world example
- I ask about something not in my existing materials
- You need to verify whether your explanation is accurate for the
  current version of the technology

When you search:
- Prefer official documentation and well-known educational sites
- Always include the source URL with any external information
- If you can't find reliable information, say so — don't guess
- Never present web search results as if they came from my notes

If web search is unavailable (no internet, tool not enabled), continue
with what you have. Note what you couldn't look up so I can research
it later.
```

Your CLAUDE.md is becoming a real conductor now. It tells Claude when to read state, which skills to load, and when and how to reach outside the project. Three chapters ago this file was a few paragraphs of instructions. Now it orchestrates an entire system.

### Step 3: Run a session — web search in action.

Open Claude Code in your `study-system/` folder:

```
claude
```

Tell Claude: "I'm weak on VPC peering — my quiz scores on networking topics are below 70%. Find me a clear explanation and create practice questions based on it."

What happens:

Claude reads `study-state.md` — confirms networking is a weak area, 62% last session. Claude reads your study-method skill — knows you prefer examples-first, analogies from your field. Then Claude searches the web for VPC peering explanations. It finds two or three sources: an AWS documentation page, a tutorial blog, maybe a Stack Overflow answer.

Here's the part that matters: Claude doesn't just paste the web results at you. It synthesizes them into an explanation that matches YOUR learning style — the style defined in your skill file. If you learn through analogies, the explanation uses analogies. If you need diagrams described, you get diagrams described. Then Claude generates five quiz questions based on the external material, covering angles your own notes never included.

The quiz hook fires. Format checks pass. State updates.

**What to check.** The explanation includes information that wasn't in your notes. Source URLs are included — you can click them and verify the information is real. The quiz questions cover aspects of VPC peering you hadn't studied before. And `study-state.md` shows the session happened and what topics were covered.

The system just did research for you. Last chapter, it could only quiz you on what you'd already provided. Now it goes out, finds better material, and builds quizzes from multiple sources — your notes, the web, and the skill's teaching preferences. The constraint moved. You're no longer limited by what you paste in.

### Step 4: (Optional) Connect to a tool you already use.

This step is optional. If you keep study materials in Notion, Google Drive, or another cloud tool, you can connect Claude to it directly. If you don't use any of these — or if web search alone feels like a big enough upgrade — skip this. Come back when you're ready.

Remote server connections are the easiest type to set up. One command, one browser login. Here's the Notion example:

```
claude mcp add --transport http notion https://mcp.notion.com/mcp
```

That's the full setup command. `claude mcp add` means "add a new connection." `--transport http` means "this is a remote server." `notion` is the name you're giving it. The URL is where the server lives.

Start Claude Code and type `/mcp`. You'll see Notion listed. It needs authentication — Claude opens your browser, you log in to Notion, you grant access. Done. Now ask Claude: "What's in my Notion workspace?" or "Find my networking study notes in Notion."

Other tools follow the same pattern. The command is always `claude mcp add --transport http [name] [url]`. The authentication is always a browser login. Sentry, Stripe, Slack, Google Drive, Linear — same pattern, different URLs.

**If it doesn't connect:** Check three things. Did you type the URL correctly? Does the service require you to have an account with certain permissions? And try running `/mcp` inside Claude Code — it shows the status of every connection and lets you retry authentication.

**If you don't use any of these tools:** That's fine. Web search is the primary connection for this book. Everything in the rest of this chapter works with web search alone. Remote server connections are a bonus for people who happen to use compatible tools.

### Step 5: Run another session — the difference compounds.

New session. Tell Claude: "Quiz me on networking — focus on my weak areas."

Claude reads `study-state.md` — sees last session covered VPC peering with web-sourced material. Networking is still flagged weak (needs more sessions to cross the 70% threshold). Claude searches the web for current networking practice questions for your specific exam. If you connected Notion, Claude also pulls in your lecture notes on subnets.

The quiz that comes back blends three things: your own notes, last session's web-sourced material, and newly found practice questions. It's broader and deeper than anything the system could produce from local files alone.

The constraint moved again. Your system isn't just a tutor anymore. It's a tutor with internet access and (optionally) access to your other tools. Same system, bigger world.

### Step 6: Verify the hooks still catch problems.

This matters. Connections bring in external data — which means external errors. The web is full of wrong answers.

Your hooks from Chapter 7 check format: question count, answer markers, word count, banned words. They won't catch a factually wrong answer pulled from a bad web source — that's beyond what a shell script can do. But they DO still verify structure, and they prevent the most common failures (missing answers, wrong format, placeholder text).

Test it. Tell Claude: "Search for common AWS networking topics and build a quiz." The hook fires and verifies the format. If you want factual verification too, that's a place where you'd add a more sophisticated check later — or review the content yourself. Hooks handle the mechanical checks. Your judgment handles the rest.

Connections bring in the world. Hooks still guard the gate. The web doesn't get a free pass just because it's external data. Your hook doesn't care where the information came from — it checks the output regardless. That's why you built hooks BEFORE connections. The guard rails were in place before the system opened up.

---

## Where This Goes: Production Connections

Here's what connections look like when they grow up.

A content production system connects to three external sources simultaneously. A web search connection finds current statistics and trends for the topic being written about. A Notion connection pulls the editorial calendar to check what's already been published and what's coming up. A Google Drive connection reads the brand guidelines PDF that lives in a shared folder.

The system doesn't just use one connection. It triangulates. The web search provides current data. Notion provides editorial context. Google Drive provides brand rules. All three feed into the same draft — which then runs through the hook pipeline before anyone sees it.

That's three connections, each serving a different purpose, each making the output better in a specific way. Your Study System uses one or two connections. A production system uses whatever it needs. Same concept, more wires.

---

## Extend It: Connections for the Other Three Systems

You've seen the pattern: give permission in `settings.json`, add a "Connections" section to the system's CLAUDE.md that tells Claude when to search and how to handle what it finds. Here's what that looks like for each system.

### Job Hunting System

Update `job-hunting/CLAUDE.md` — add:

```markdown
## Connections

You have web search access. Use it when:
- I give you a job posting — research the company before writing the
  cover letter. Find: recent news, company values, tech stack, culture
  signals, Glassdoor sentiment.
- I'm preparing for an interview — find the company's recent blog
  posts, press releases, and product launches.
- A role mentions a technology or methodology I haven't covered — look
  it up so you can speak to it accurately in the cover letter.

When you search:
- Include source URLs for company research findings
- Separate facts (from their website/press releases) from opinions
  (from Glassdoor/Reddit)
- If you can't verify something, flag it — don't invent company details
```

What changes: the cover letter for Datadog now opens with a reference to their recent product launch — something you didn't paste in. The system researched the company on its own. The career-profile skill provides your experience; web search provides the company context. And the hook still verifies that experience claims match your career profile. Connections don't bypass guard rails.

### Project Management System

Update `project-mgmt/CLAUDE.md` — add:

```markdown
## Connections

You have web search access. Use it when:
- I reference a tool, framework, or methodology you need context on
- A status update needs industry benchmarks for comparison
- I ask you to research best practices for a specific project challenge

If a remote connection to Notion, Linear, or Jira is configured:
- Read project tasks and status updates from the connected tool
- Pull meeting notes and specs without me copying them in
- Never modify data in the connected tool — read only

If connections are unavailable, continue with local state and skill
files. Note any gaps so I know what wasn't included.
```

What changes: Monday morning status reports now include context you didn't manually provide. If you connected a project tool, Claude reads the latest updates and task changes before generating the report. The PM methodology skill shapes the format; the connection provides fresh data.

### Content System

Update `content/CLAUDE.md` — add:

```markdown
## Connections

You have web search access. Use it when:
- Researching a topic before drafting — find 3+ credible sources
- Fact-checking claims in a draft — verify statistics, quotes, dates
- Looking for the current conversation around a topic — what are
  people saying? What angles have been covered? What's missing?

When you search for research:
- Always note the source URL
- Flag anything you couldn't verify with "[VERIFY: source needed]"
- Distinguish between primary sources (research, official data) and
  secondary (blog posts, opinion pieces)
```

What changes: before drafting a blog post, Claude researches the topic — finding sources, data points, and angles you didn't provide. The draft arrives with citations. The content-quality hook verifies that every factual claim has a source or a `[VERIFY]` flag. Connections feed the system; hooks check what it produces.

---

## Maintain It: Connection Health

Connections are the most fragile component you've built. Every other component — your CLAUDE.md, state files, skills, hooks — lives in your project folder. You control them completely. Connections reach outside, and outside is unpredictable.

**Monthly connection check.** Open Claude Code. Type `/mcp`. You'll see every configured connection, its status, and how many tools it provides. For each one:

Web search: run a test query. Does Claude return current results? If results seem stale or web search appears disabled, check your permissions in `settings.json`.

Remote servers: does the connection still work? Did your authentication expire? Try a simple request — "list my recent pages in Notion" or "show my open issues." If it fails, re-authenticate through the `/mcp` panel.

Remove connections you're not using. Every connection is a potential failure point. If you configured a Notion connection three months ago and haven't used it since, remove it: `claude mcp remove notion`. Fewer connections, fewer things to break.

**Handle failures gracefully.** Your CLAUDE.md already says "if connections are unavailable, continue with local data." But test it. Turn off WiFi. Run a study session. Does the system work — slower, narrower, but functional? Or does it stop cold because it can't search?

If it stops cold, the problem is in your CLAUDE.md. The instructions make the connection sound mandatory. Rewrite: "Use web search when available. If unavailable, note what you couldn't look up and continue with what you have."

**Watch for over-reliance.** If your study session ran 15 web searches on a topic you already had good notes for, that's waste. The connection should supplement your local files, not replace them. Add a line to your state file tracking connection usage:

```markdown
## Connection Usage

| Date | Connection | Queries | Notes |
|------|-----------|---------|-------|
| | | | |
```

Not detailed billing — just awareness. Over time, you'll see whether connections are adding value or just adding noise.

**The rule:** Connections are enhancements, not foundations. Your system should work without them — slower, with less data, but functional. If removing a connection breaks the system entirely, you've built on sand.

Five components working together now. Instructions define the system. Skills carry expertise. State tracks history. Hooks verify quality. Connections bring in the world.

```
[Your notes] + [Root CLAUDE.md + Study CLAUDE.md]
             + [study-method skill]
             + [study-state.md]
             + [WEB SEARCH -> external sources]

                              |
                    [study-state.md updated]
```

The system is no longer a closed box. It reaches outside for better material, then checks what it found before using it. The guard rails don't care where the data came from. They check everything.

---

## Break It on Purpose

Three tests. Each one proves a different thing.

**Test 1 — Remove web search.** Edit `settings.json` and delete `WebSearch` from the permissions. Run a study session on a weak topic. Claude still works — but it can only use your notes and what it already knows. The explanation is generic, not current. The quiz questions are the same kind you've already seen.

Now restore web search. Run the same request. The difference: current information, diverse sources, broader questions. That gap is what connections buy you.

**Test 2 — Feed it a bad source.** Tell Claude: "I found this explanation of VPC peering on a blog: [paste something with a deliberate error]. Build quiz questions from it." Does the quiz hook catch the error? If the hook checks answers against established facts, it should flag the problem. If not, the hook needs tightening — it should verify answers against reliable sources, not just check formatting.

This test is important. Connections bring in unverified data. The web is not authoritative. Your hooks are the last line of defense. If they only check formatting, they'll miss factual errors from external sources. Tighten them.

**Test 3 — Disconnect and degrade.** Turn off WiFi. Run a study session. The system should work — slower, narrower, but functional. Claude uses your local notes and its existing knowledge. It notes what it couldn't look up. The output is less comprehensive, but it's still useful.

If Claude stops cold because it can't search — refuses to help, errors out, sits there waiting — your CLAUDE.md instructions need the "if unavailable, continue" clause. Go back to Step 2 and make sure that fallback instruction is clear.

Connections are powerful when they're working and invisible when they're not — IF you built your system to handle both states. That's the mark of a well-designed system. It gets worse gracefully. It doesn't crash.

---

## How to Know It's Clicking

Five checks.

**Web search works.** In a study session, Claude returns information that isn't in your notes — with source URLs. You can click the URLs and verify the information exists.

**External data improves output.** Compare a study session WITH web search to one WITHOUT (your Test 1). The web-search session produces broader, more current material. The difference is obvious, not subtle.

**Hooks still catch errors.** External data doesn't bypass quality checks. Feed the system bad external information (your Test 2). The hook catches it — or you know what to tighten.

**Graceful degradation.** Without internet access, the system still works using local files. It notes what it couldn't look up. It doesn't crash or refuse to help.

**You can name the full stack.** "My Study System has five components: CLAUDE.md for instructions, the study-method skill for expertise, study-state.md for memory, the quiz hook for quality checks, and web search plus an optional remote connection for outside data. The system knows what to do, how to do it well, what happened before, checks its own output, and reaches outside for better material."

And the gap: your systems now have all five individual components. Each one does its job. But the system still does everything in a single pass — you ask, Claude responds. For simple tasks, that's fine. For complex work — producing a research-backed blog post, running a full study session, preparing a complete job application — one pass isn't enough. The AI researches, outlines, drafts, and polishes all at once, and the quality suffers everywhere. Chapter 9 breaks work into stages, with a quality gate between each one. The system stops doing everything at once and starts doing each thing well.
