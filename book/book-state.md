## System Growth Across Chapters

| Chapter | Study | Job Hunting | Project Mgmt | Content |
|---------|-------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| Ch 1–3 | "before" prompt | "before" prompt | "before" prompt | "before" prompt |
| Ch 4 | **v1: prompt (deep)** | v1: prompt | v1: prompt | v1: prompt |
| Ch 5 | v2: + state | **v2: + state (deep)** | v2: + state | v2: + state |
| Ch 7 | v3: + skill | v3: + skill | v3: + skill | **v3: + skill (deep)** |
| Ch 8 | v4: + hook | **v4: + hook (deep)** | v4: + hook | v4: + hook |
| Ch 10 | **v5: + connection (deep)** | v5: + connection | v5: + connection | v5: + connection |
| Ch 11 | v6: + pipeline | v6: + pipeline | v6: + pipeline | **v6: + pipeline (deep)** |

**(deep)** = primary build for that chapter with full walkthrough.

## Files

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `outline-v3.md` | Canonical outline | DONE |
| `act1-detailed-outlines.md` | Detailed outlines for Ch 1, 2, 3 | DONE |
| `ch01-outline.md` | Ch 1 writing blueprint | DONE |
| `ch01-draft.md` | Ch 1 first draft (~3,200 words) | DONE — needs review |

## Current Priority

**Now: Act 1 Drafting**
- ✅ Ch 1 draft complete
- ⏳ Ch 2 draft — detailed outline exists in `act1-detailed-outlines.md`
- ⏳ Ch 3 draft — detailed outline exists in `act1-detailed-outlines.md`
- ⏳ Review Ch 1 draft (score against rubric)

**Next: Act 2 Detailed Outlines**
- Ch 4–6 detailed outlines (Part II: First Builds)
- Ch 7–9 detailed outlines (Part III: Knowledge & Guard Rails)

**Later**
- Ch 10–11 detailed outlines (Part IV: Connections & Pipelines)
- Ch 12–13 detailed outlines (Part V: Mastery)
- MCP/connection research for Ch 10
- Systems-thinking source material for Ch 3, 12 (Meadows, Goldratt)

---

## Blockers

- **MCP/connection research (Ch 10)**: Need step-by-step guide for non-technical users — which MCP servers, APIs, CLI tools work in Cowork.
- **Systems-thinking source material (Ch 3, 12)**: Donella Meadows, Goldratt concepts to translate for the audience.
