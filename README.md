# Enter the System

**Building AI Systems That Actually Work**

A book teaching knowledge workers how to think in systems and build AI systems — not just write prompts. The reader learns to decompose work into components (instructions, memory, control, flow) and wire them together so AI produces reliable results every time.

## Who This Is For

People who already use AI for everyday tasks but hit the wall: prompts work once then break, context gets re-explained every session, output can't be trusted without manual checking. They're smart and motivated — they just need the framework.

## Book Structure

**2 Acts, 13 Chapters, 4 Throughline Systems**

| Act | Chapters | What Happens |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| **Act 1: The System** | Ch 1-3 | Universal systems thinking. Tool-agnostic. The reader runs 5 study sessions in any AI tool, feels each concept work and fail manually. |
| **Act 2: The Build** | Ch 4-13 | Real systems in Claude Code (Cowork). Each chapter introduces one component and builds it into 4 throughline systems. |

### The 4 Throughline Systems

Each starts as a basic prompt and grows across the book into a full 6-component system:

- **Study System** — from "quiz me" to adaptive learning
- **Job Hunting System** — from one-shot cover letters to a tracked campaign
- **Project Management System** — from to-do lists to audience-routed status reports
- **Content System** — from generic drafts to a voice-matched production pipeline

### The Framework

**4 Universal Concepts** (tool-agnostic): Instruction, Memory, Control, Flow

**6 Implementation Components** (Cowork): Prompt, State, Skill, Hook, Connection, Pipeline

**3 Design Patterns**: Loop, Gate, Router
